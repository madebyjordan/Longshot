"""The launcher, for Linux: the Windows launcher's one screen (builder/HookshotBuilder/MainWindow.xaml, Launcher.cs and the
build in MainWindow.xaml.cs, as drawn in Paper's "Hookshot v2") on a Tk canvas. The wordmark over a dim picture of the game,
Play, and the version the game folder holds under it. Menu opens a panel from the left with three tabs: Build (the game
files, the folder, Build Game, and the build's options; the build fills its button), Releases (the versions, each brought into
the folder by a press: launch_list.py) and Settings; at its foot Check for updates, which becomes Update Available, and the
bar of an update under way.

launcher_art.py paints the picture, the shapes and the panel's ground (numpy); this file lays them out in the drawing's own
measures (a 960 x 640 window, scaled as the builder's is), draws the panel's square boxes and writes the text over them, and
does what a press asks for. Tk has no buttons that are see-through or torn at the edge, so the canvas is the whole screen and
this file finds what the pointer is on (regions).

What Windows has and this has not: its own title bar (the window manager draws one here), dev builds as folders beside the
game (scripts/build-game.ps1 makes them there), the game files found on the PC by themselves and dropped onto the window, and
AMD FSR 4."""
