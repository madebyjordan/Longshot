# Versioning and releases

Hookshot follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Releases are made with
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please): the version and the changelog come from the
[Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) titles of the pull requests merged into `main`.

The git tag is the source of truth. The game reads it through `nx2/version.py`, and the builder and the AppImage are
stamped from the same tag when they are packaged. `.release-please-manifest.json` holds the last released version for
release-please, a release candidate's or a promoted one's; it is changed only by the release pull request and by
Promote. The release pull request also writes the version to `.release-please-version` (release-please's version
file, named so: a `version.txt` at the root would be read by `nx2/version.py` as the release name of every build from
the checkout).

## The version number

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, with an optional prerelease suffix: `2.0.7`, `2.1.0`, `2.1.0-rc.1`. A release is tagged `v2.0.7`:
the `v` belongs to the tag, not to the version. Build metadata is not used in tags.

One version covers the whole project: the game (`hookshot.exe` / `hookshot`), the Vulkan back end, the lift pipeline
and its scripts, Hookshot Builder and the Linux AppImage. They are built from the same commit and released together,
so they never carry different versions.

The "public" surface the rules protect is the command line of `make_game.py` and the builder, the `RX_` and `HOS_`
switches, the files a build writes into a game folder (`hookshot_options.ini`, `hookshot_env.txt`, `language.txt`,
`hookshot_version.txt`), saves, and the format of `hookshot_log.txt`. The C sources and internal headers are not an
API and may change in any release.

## Pull request titles decide the version

Pull requests are squash-merged, so each one becomes a single commit on `main` whose subject is the pull request's
title. The *PR title* workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`) checks that the title is a Conventional Commit:

```
type(scope): description
type(scope)!: description        (a breaking change)
```

`scope` is optional. A `!` before the colon, or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body, marks a breaking change. The
description becomes the changelog line. The allowed types and examples are in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-titles).

Every release is first a release candidate (below), so the next version is a release candidate's:

| Commit | After `2.0.7` (released) | After `2.0.8-rc.1` (a release candidate) | Changelog section |
|---|---|---|---|
| any commit with `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` | `3.0.0-rc.1` | `3.0.0-rc.1` | its own section, and its type's |
| `feat` | `2.1.0-rc.1` | `2.1.0-rc.1` | Features |
| `fix` | `2.0.8-rc.1` | `2.0.8-rc.2` | Bug Fixes |
| `perf` | `2.0.8-rc.1` | `2.0.8-rc.2` | Performance Improvements |
| `revert` | `2.0.8-rc.1` | `2.0.8-rc.2` | Reverts |
| `refactor`, `build`, `ci`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `chore` | `2.0.8-rc.1` | `2.0.8-rc.2` | its own section (Code Refactoring, Build System, Continuous Integration, Documentation, Tests, Styles, Miscellaneous Chores) |

A release candidate of a minor version (`2.1.0-rc.1`) goes on to `2.1.0-rc.2` for a `feat` too, and one of a major
version (`3.0.0-rc.1`) for any commit. One exception, from release-please's prerelease versioning
(`versioning: prerelease`): a version that moves up during a series keeps the release candidate number, so a `feat`
after `2.0.8-rc.2` proposes `2.1.0-rc.2`, not `2.1.0-rc.1`. To start the new version at `rc.1`, put
`Release-As: 2.1.0-rc.1` in that pull request's squash-merge description.

A release takes the highest bump among its commits. A commit whose subject is not a Conventional Commit (a merge
commit, or a pull request merged without squashing) is not read, so its change makes no release and is not in the
changelog.

To choose the version yourself, put a `Release-As:` footer in the body of a commit on `main` (the squash-merge's
description works). Name a release candidate, so the release still goes through Promote:

```
fix(vk): keep the swapchain when the window is moved

Release-As: 2.1.0-rc.1
```

## How a release is made

The [Release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) makes every release in two steps: a release candidate, a
prerelease for testing, and then, when one is good, Promote, which publishes it as its version.

### Release candidates

On every push to `main`:

1. release-please reads the commits since the last release candidate. If any of them makes a release, it opens a pull
   request titled `chore: release <version>` (or updates the open one), for the next release candidate:
   `2.0.8-rc.1` after the release `2.0.7`, `2.0.8-rc.2` after `2.0.8-rc.1`. It changes `.release-please-manifest.json`
   and puts the new entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`: the changes since the release candidate before it. The entry
   can be edited in that pull request before it is merged.
2. Merging the release pull request (squash or not; it is the one exception) makes the release candidate. On that
   push, release-please tags the merge commit `v<version>` (`v2.0.8-rc.1`) and makes its GitHub release as a draft,
   with the changelog entry as its notes.
3. The same workflow calls the Linux AppImage and Windows builder workflows on the tag. The jobs that build the files
   sign their build provenance (below), and the release jobs attach them with `scripts/release_upload.sh`:
   `Hookshot-v<version>-x86_64.AppImage`, its `.zsync` and `hookshot-linux.txt`; `HookshotBuilder.exe` (the setup),
   `hookshot-setup.txt` and the RecompLauncher zip. New update parts go to the `linux-parts` and `builder-parts`
   releases.
4. The publish job adds `SHA256SUMS` and the "Which file do I download?" table under the notes
   (`scripts/release_files.sh finish`), checks that all the files are there and that `SHA256SUMS` lists every file
   with its digest, and publishes the draft as a prerelease. It is never "latest". Players on the Release track do not
   see it; see *Update tracks* below. A release candidate's `HookshotBuilder.exe` installs that release candidate, and
   its AppImage's update information names its own release, so AppImageUpdate never takes it back to an older release.

The next release pull request proposes the next release candidate of the same version, `2.0.8-rc.2`, with the changes
since `rc.1`. There is no step to start a series: the first fix after a release proposes the next version's `rc.1`.

### Promoting a release candidate

When a release candidate is good, start the Release workflow by hand on `main` (Actions > Release > Run workflow), with
its tag (`v2.0.8-rc.2`), or empty for the newest release candidate. From the GitHub CLI:
`gh workflow run release.yml -R NotRexed/Hookshot -f rc=v2.0.8-rc.2`.

1. `scripts/release_promote.sh prepare` checks that the release candidate is a published prerelease on `main`, tags
   its version (`v2.0.8`) on the same commit, and makes that release as a draft. Its notes are those of the version's
   release candidates up to that one, newest first, so they add up to every change since the last release.
2. The Linux AppImage and Windows builder workflows build the version's files from that commit, and the publish job
   checks them and publishes the release as "latest", as above. The files are built again, not copied from the release
   candidate: every file names the version it was built as (the tools' `version.txt`, the AppImage's `VERSION` and
   name, the setup lists' `tag` line), and the builder, the game and the Linux updater compare that with the latest
   release's tag, so a `2.0.8-rc.2` file on the `v2.0.8` release would be offered as an update forever. The source is
   the same commit, the dependencies are the same checked downloads, and the update parts that did not change are the
   same files on `builder-parts` and `linux-parts`, so a player who tried the release candidate downloads only the
   parts that name the version.
3. The record job sets `.release-please-manifest.json` to `2.0.8` (`scripts/release_promote.sh record`) and adds the
   version's entry to `CHANGELOG.md`, then has release-please make the release pull request again: it now proposes
   `2.0.9-rc.1` (or `2.1.0-rc.1`), with the changes since the promoted commit. It pushes that commit to `main` with
   the workflow's token. If `main` takes no direct push (a branch protection rule or ruleset), it opens a small pull
   request `chore(release): record 2.0.8 as released` instead. Merge it before the release pull request, or the
   release pull request still proposes another `2.0.8` release candidate.

If a build fails, the release stays a draft: re-run the failed jobs of that Release run. Files already on the release
are replaced, so a re-run never fails because of them. Promote can also be started again with the same release
candidate: it goes on with the tag and the draft it made. With the repository variable `CI_RELEASE_WINDOWS` set to
`false`, the Windows files are left for you to upload, and the draft for you to publish: upload them, then run
`scripts/release_files.sh finish v<version>` (with `GH_REPO` set) before publishing, so `SHA256SUMS` lists them too.
After a promotion, the record job then does not run: set the manifest and the changelog by hand
(`scripts/release_promote.sh record v<version> v<version>-rc.<n>` in a checkout, with `GH_REPO` set) and merge that.

The releases are made with the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and the builds are called from the same workflow, so no
personal access token is needed. A pull request opened by `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not start other workflows, though, so
the release pull request has no checks of its own: it changes only the changelog and the manifest.

## The nightly prerelease

Every push to `main` also updates `nightly`, the latest development build. Once the Linux AppImage and Windows builder
workflows have built that commit, their release jobs move the `nightly` tag to it and replace the files of the
`nightly` prerelease with the same files a release has (`scripts/release_upload.sh nightly ...`), `SHA256SUMS` and
the build provenance included. The notes name the commit and its date. It is a prerelease, never "latest", and not a
version: `nightly` is not a `v*` tag, so release-please and `git describe` ignore it; the builders and the game read it only on the Nightly track. A
run that finishes after a newer push leaves it alone. Its new parts go to `linux-parts` and `builder-parts`, like a
release's. Its AppImage's update information names the `nightly` release instead of `latest`, so AppImageUpdate
updates a nightly AppImage to the next nightly. (Gear Lever reads only `latest`, `latest-pre` and `latest-all`, and
offers the latest release for any other name.)

## Update tracks

The builders (Windows and Linux) have an **Update track** menu: Release, Release candidate or Nightly. By default it
is the track of the build installed, read from its version: `v2.0.7` is a release, `v2.1.0-rc.1` a release candidate,
and git describe's `v2.1.0-rc.1-3-g1a2b3c4` the nightly (named with `--long`, so a nightly built on a tagged commit is
`-0-g...` and still says so). A choice is saved with the builder's settings.

| Track | Updates to | Offered when |
|---|---|---|
| Release | the latest release | it is another version (as before) |
| Release candidate | the newest of the release candidates and releases (semver: `rc.2` > `rc.1`, `2.1.0` > `2.1.0-rc.2`) | it is newer: never an older release, and the release of its own version once that ships |
| Nightly | the `nightly` release's build (its list's `tag` line) | it is another build |

Choosing another track installs that track's newest build, an older version too (the builder asks first). The game's
own update check (`host/hos_update.c`) follows the track of the folder's version. The same rules are in
`builder/HookshotBuilder/Updater.cs`, `builder/linux/linux_update.py` and `tests/test_update_tracks.py`. A release
candidate's and the nightly's `HookshotBuilder.exe` are built with `HOOKSHOT_SETUP_RELEASE`, so started with no `--tag`
they install their own release (`builder/setup/setup.c`).

## The files of a release

The names never change: the builder's update check, the setup and the Linux updater look for them by name.

| File | For |
|---|---|
| `HookshotBuilder.exe` | Windows: the setup players download. It reads `hookshot-setup.txt` and downloads the rest |
| `Hookshot-v<version>-x86_64.AppImage` | Linux and Steam Deck |
| `hookshot-setup.txt` | the setup's and the Windows builder's update list (`builder/setup/setup.c`, `builder/HookshotBuilder/Updater.cs`) |
| `hookshot-linux.txt` | the Linux updater's list (`builder/linux/linux_update.py`) |
| `Hookshot-v<version>-x86_64.AppImage.zsync` | AppImageUpdate and Gear Lever, which update the AppImage itself |
| `SHA256SUMS` | the SHA-256 of every other file, in `sha256sum`'s format |

The release notes end with a short table of which file to download (`scripts/release_files.sh table`).

The AppImage carries update information (`scripts/linux/appimage.sh`):
`gh-releases-zsync|NotRexed|Hookshot|latest|Hookshot-*-x86_64.AppImage.zsync`, the repository being the one CI runs
in. appimagetool writes it into the image and makes the `.zsync`, whose file URL is the AppImage's name beside it on the
same release. `./Hookshot-v<version>-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-updateinformation` prints it.

To check a download, put it beside `SHA256SUMS` and run `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS`. Every file,
`SHA256SUMS` too, also has a build provenance attestation (`actions/attest-build-provenance`), signed by the workflow
run that built it. With the GitHub CLI:

```
gh attestation verify HookshotBuilder.exe -R NotRexed/Hookshot
```

It passes only for a file built by this repository's workflows, and shows the commit and the run.

## Tags pushed by hand

A `v*` tag pushed by hand (`git tag v2.0.8-rc.9 <commit>`, `git push origin v2.0.8-rc.9`) still starts the Linux
AppImage and Windows builder workflows, which make its release, with GitHub's generated notes, and attach the files,
`SHA256SUMS` and the table. A tag with a prerelease part is a prerelease. release-please is not involved, and the next
release pull request does not change, so this is only for a one-off test build; releases go through the release pull
request and Promote.

## Hotfixes

Fix on `main` with a `fix:` pull request, merge the release pull request (the next release candidate) and promote
it. The project does not keep maintenance
branches for older versions: only the newest release is supported. A tag pushed by hand on another branch is built
and released the same way as a release candidate, but release-please only follows `main`. Merge that commit into
`main` afterwards, or the next release pull request does not know about the tag.

## Where the version appears

| Place | Where it comes from |
|---|---|
| git tag | release-please (a release candidate), Promote (its version), or a tag pushed by hand; the source of truth |
| `.release-please-manifest.json` | the release pull request, and Promote |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | the release pull request, and Promote |
| `hookshot_log.txt` and the Insert menu | `nx2/version.py`: `HOOKSHOT_VERSION`, then `VERSION`/`version.txt`, then `git describe --tags --match "v[0-9]*"` |
| `hookshot_version.txt` in a build | the `VERSION` file written when the tools are packaged (`nx2/make_game.py`) |
| AppImage file name | a release's tag (`HOOKSHOT_VERSION`), else `git describe --tags --match "v[0-9]*"` (`scripts/linux/appimage.sh`) |
| `HookshotBuilder.exe` | the MSBuild `Version` passed at publish time (`dotnet publish -p:Version=<version>`, the Windows builder workflow); the `csproj`'s `0.1.0` is only the default for a local build |

`nx2/version.py` also appends a fingerprint of the source files, `(source 1a2b3c4d)`. It is not a version: it tells
two builds of the same release apart, and it is the only identifier a build from a modified checkout has.

## The changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is written by release-please, newest first, one section per release candidate, each with the changes
since the one before. A promoted version's section is a line naming the release candidate it is, above them. Do not
rewrite a released entry;
a correction is a new pull request and a new release. `changelog.txt` is the earlier changelog in Factorio's format,
written by hand for `0.1.0`. It is kept for history and is no longer updated.

## History

Tags from before versioning (`Release`, `amd`, `text-hotfix`, and so on) are snapshots of the old workflow. They stay
in the repository for history but are not releases: the tooling matches only `v[0-9]*` tags.

## Rules

- Do not edit a version number in a file, move a tag or reuse a version. The release pull request and Promote change
  the manifest; nothing else does.
- Do not put game files, keys, builds or anything made from a dump in a release. `scripts/release_upload.sh` refuses
  file names that look like them, or like NVIDIA's runtime files.
