"""The pipeline state list: the back end's record (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp StateRec) and the tools that merge and ship the lists agree.

A list made by one build is read by another (that is its point): its record size and magic are a file format. nx2/pipeline_states.py
merges lists into assets/pipeline_states.bin.xz, each pipeline once, and nx2/make_game.py unpacks that beside the game. Synthetic data only.
