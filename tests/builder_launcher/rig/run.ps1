# The launcher bringing versions, tried whole without a game, a release or GitHub:
#
#   powershell -File tests/builder_launcher/rig/run.ps1
#
# It makes up releases (rig.py: their setup lists and parts, handed out by a web server on this PC), a scratch install with
# v2.1.0 in use (HOOKSHOT_SETUP_BASE) and a game folder holding v2.1.0, and compiles the setup (builder/setup/setup.c) and a
# stand-in for a version's python.exe that says what make_game.py says while it builds (fakepy.c). Then:
#   1. the setup's engine mode alone (--engine --tag <tag>): what it installs, links, leaves alone and says;
#   2. the launcher itself (the Debug build of builder/HookshotBuilder, when it is built), its button pressed for a version: the
#      builder installed, the folder built, a build that stops, a build cancelled, a download that fails, the latest release, the builder opened
#      with nothing asked. Its window is drawn to PNG files away from the screen (HOOKSHOT_UI_SHOT), for a look.
# Nothing of the real install (%LOCALAPPDATA%\LongshotBuilder) or of a real game is read or written: that is checked too.
#
# -Mingw: llvm-mingw's bin folder (default: an installed Longshot Builder's, else %LLVM_MINGW%\bin). -Builder: the builder to
# press (default: the Debug build). -Out: where the rig and the pictures go (default: %TEMP%\longshot-launcher-rig).
