# What a release gets once its files are on it: big download links for Windows and Linux above its notes, a "Which file
# do I download?" table under them, and SHA256SUMS,
# the SHA-256 of every other file on it in sha256sum's format (sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS checks a
# download). The sums are GitHub's own digests of the uploaded files; a file without one is downloaded and hashed.
# The Release workflow's publish job runs this for a release before publishing it, and scripts/release_upload.sh for
# a tag pushed by hand (and the nightly). Needs gh, with GH_TOKEN (contents: write) and GH_REPO set.
#
#   scripts/release_files.sh table <tag>             the table, in Markdown
#   scripts/release_files.sh links <tag>             the download links, in Markdown (from the files on the release)
#   scripts/release_files.sh finish <tag> [<out>]    the table under the notes (once), and SHA256SUMS uploaded (also
#                                                    written to <out>). Two runs at once (the Linux and Windows release
#                                                    jobs of a tag) leave the sums of every file: each one checks the
#                                                    uploaded SHA256SUMS against the files after uploading it.
#   scripts/release_files.sh check <tag> <name> ...  each named file and SHA256SUMS are on the release, and SHA256SUMS
#                                                    lists every other file on it, with its digest
